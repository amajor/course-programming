# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is primarily a client-side (in your browser, not in a server) language used for front-end development. That is, it manages how the page looks and reacts as the user interacts with the site. It can also be used as a server-side language.

It has a funny history. You should read more about that [here](https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript). It's a language that was built in 10 days and as a result can be difficult to debug.

It was named very similarly to Java as a marketing ploy, but it is not related to Java in any way. They are two different languages.

But many of us love it none-the-less.

JavaScript can be used for small site enhancements, like infinite scrolling (like at [giphy.com](https://giphy.com/)). Or it can be used to build entire web applications, games, art, and even control robots. There are a multitude of things you can do with JavaScript!
