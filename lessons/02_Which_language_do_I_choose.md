# How do I choose which language to start with?

Google this topic, and you'll find a [plethora of answers](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=which+programming+language+should+I+learn+first).

This question is so common, there are even infographics _([image credit](http://carlcheo.com/startcoding))_ for it.

Here are some great ideas on what to consider, from [freeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-programming-language-should-i-learn-first-%CA%87d%C4%B1%C9%B9%C9%94s%C9%90%CA%8C%C9%90%C9%BE-%C9%B9%C7%9D%CA%8Dsu%C9%90-19a33b0a467d):

* the job market for the language
* the long term prospects for the language
* how easy the language is to learn
* what projects you can build while youâ€™re learning (and share with friends so you can stay motivated)

Ultimately, if you're pursuing a career in programming, you will learn more than one language. It's unavoidable. At least if you want to be employed.

But in all honesty, once you understand the fundamentals of a programming language and gain some confidence in one, learning others comes pretty naturally. The implementation and syntax is different for each language, but as long as you know how to use a search engine and you've already got a baseline for what and how to pull off different things with code, you can figure out how to write in other languages.

So start with one language. Learn it really well. Then learn another one.

We're going to start with JavaScript.

Let's make a note right now. **JavaScript and Java are two different languages.** I mixed them up before I knew better. I've even had recruiters tell me that they have a Java opening and then describe the position that will be writing JavaScript... It's not the same.

Back to JavaScript. This language has a lot of pitfalls, but it's usable in all of your web browsers and can also be used to make native mobile apps and even desktop apps.

It's a great place to start and chances are you'll run into a time where it'll be helpful to know the basics.

Couple JavaScript with knowing HTML and CSS and you'll be able to do SO MUCH. If you want to have some instant gratification and see the code you write start doing things on the screen, these languages give you that experience.
